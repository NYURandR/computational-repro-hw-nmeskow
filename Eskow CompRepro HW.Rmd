## Homework

1) Please explain 1 of Wilson et. al's suggestions for good practices in computational reproducibility:

In terms of data management, Wilson et al recommends saving all data in both raw and intermediate forms, and ensuring that data is backed up in multiple locations. It's also recommended to create a version of the data that is clean and "analysis-friendly." In addition, it is helpful to document all steps used to process data, and use unique identifiers for every record.


2) Please find the square root of 4 to the 13th power, writing your code in the gray box below so that it executes and provides the answer. Hit the play button to make sure it works:

```{r}
sqrt(4^13)
```

3) Save your file and add it to your GitHub repository at: https://classroom.github.com/a/WO52_vGE
